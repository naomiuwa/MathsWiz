# MathsWiz (not the official name yet)

This project is aimed at helping children learn and practise their multiplication skills. Our shared experience of working in schools and homeschooling, inspired us to build a fun and interactive app to ultimately help children boost their confidence and profiency in this essential mathematical skill.
